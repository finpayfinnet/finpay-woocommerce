#### Manual Clean Up WP Options Config Value of This Plugin

<details><summary>Click to expand info</summary>
<br>

In general use-case, you don't need to do what explained in this section. This section is relevent only in case **you want to know/clean-up/remove** `wp_options` config values created by this plugin. Those config values are located under your WP's database SQL table `wp_options` with record's name prefix `woocommerce_finpay_`. 
	
You can also find it by executing this SQL on your WP's database to find those values:
```sql
SELECT * FROM `wp_options` WHERE `option_name` LIKE '%woocommerce_finpay%'
```
Then if you want, you can remove the values from the SQL database (alternatively, you can also modify the SQL `SELECT` command with `DELETE`). 
	
Background: 
	
This plugin was mainly developed by following the official guideline from WooCommerce(WC), where WooCommerce provided their internal API function to create/edit WP options, we donâ€™t use WP options API function directly. It seems the default WC Payment Gateway behavior (when uninstalled) does not include the uninstall clean up procedure to remove wp_options config values. Though that may be by design from WC, they may have decided that Gateway Settings/options should preserved during uninstall, so that upon re-install the Settings is auto-restored.
